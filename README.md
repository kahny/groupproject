#Backyard App

###Description: 
This site was made as part of a group project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive during the week of 8/29/14-9/4/14.  Taking inspiration from Airbnb, the purpose of the site is to recreate a booking site where people can rent out their backyards and pools.
